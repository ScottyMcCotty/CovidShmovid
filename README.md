## _**Description**_
We plan to redesign the CDC COVID guidelines web page into a much more intuitive structure. We would like it to allow users to input their current status (vaccinated, boosted, tested positive, rapid vs PCR test, symptomatic or not, degree of COVID exposure, etc.) page by page, like a choose-your-own-adventure design using a tree structure. At the end of the process, the page will clearly display the next steps the user should take given their current circumstances.

## _**Motivation**_
When unvaccinated people feel the symptoms of COVID, they might wonder what to do next. When vaccinated people have been in contact with people who have tested positive, they need to know what steps to follow. Any time someone has a question about current COVID guidelines, they need a resource to use for relevant information.

A universal, all-covering COVID resource — like the CDC — would allow every user to have access to the same information, which helps to battle the spread of misinformation while ensuring that society is staying safe. However, the CDC’s COVID information webpages are badly formatted and difficult to navigate. When someone has questions about their COVID situation, they need to be able to consult a clear trustworthy database of information.

## _**Defining the Problem**_
The current issue with the CDC website is a lack of readability and accessibility. When an individual has questions regarding the current COVID guidelines issued by the CDC, sometimes it’s difficult to understand the information on their website. There is an overwhelming amount of disorganized text with often repetitive information. Clear guidelines dependent on your COVID-positive status, symptom status, vaccination status, and whether you took a PCR or rapid test are difficult to synthesize from the vast amount of information presented on one page. If I want to know how long I should quarantine if I am an unvaccinated individual who was recently exposed to an individual in the past 5 days that tested positive, I have to scour through a heap of text to find the information that represents my situation.

## _**Why is this interesting?**_
It is important for people to know and have access to accurate information about COVID, especially since it has been such a prevalent part of the last few years in everyone’s lives. The COVID-19 pandemic changed the world drastically, forcing everyone to stay indoors and isolated from others in an attempt to curb the spread of the deadly disease.

Despite the fact that COVID has been such a major issue over the last two years and has impacted so many lives, there is still a lack of well designed resources that provide all of the information necessary for people to know what to do if they are exposed to COVID. Although the CDC has made an effort to add all of this information and other tips to their own website, it is not organized in an intuitive way. Additionally, many people have lost trust in the CDC after the CDC has constantly changed their suggestions for what individuals should do if they contract COVID, turning the CDC into somewhat of a controversial organization despite the fact that its original goal was to inform the public on solutions for preventing and fighting disease.

By redesigning the information provided on the CDC website to accurately explain the steps to take about their specific COVID situation, we will be able to disseminate information to people who need it better.

## _**Suggested Solution**_
One way to overcome the overwhelming information as put out by CDC and therefore immense searching is by guiding users through the implementation of a choose-your-own-adventure style application. By answering a series of questions, we can narrow to the information that the user needs based on their responses. This will improve accessibility to the right information and actions they can take to overcome a particular covid-situation. 

## _**Implementation**_
We plan to design our webpage using basic HTML/JavaScript/CSS. In the unlikely event that we have enough time, we may elect to use a React.js framework to elevate the user interface and experience.

For our prototype webpage, we plan to demonstrate our work using the VSCode extension Live Server, which will launch a local development server with live reload feature for static & dynamic pages. For a more permanent solution, we plan to utilize Flask for our Python backend and we will host our website with Google Cloud.

We’ll use Github for version control and Trello to manage the project, keeping track of tasks and deadlines. We plan to establish an Agile-style development process. Our design sketches begin in Lucidchart, a sharable charting website. Then, for greater detail and accuracy, we might use another UI mock-up application such as Figma. Here, we will establish our color scheme, page transitions, and simplicity of use.
